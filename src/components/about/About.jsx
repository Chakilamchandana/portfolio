          <p>
            I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Indiana University
            Bloomington with over four years of practical know-how. My passion
            lies in software and web development, as well as tech support. I
            strive to explore new technologies that enhance the user experience,
            create seamless interfaces, derive insights from data, and provide
            professional technical support to users.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With a strong software engineering background and a keen interest in
            data analysis, I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions,
            driving innovation, and using data to make informed decisions. By
            combining my expertise in development and analysis, I aim to create
            impactful solutions that integrate both disciplines and provide
            valuable insights to drive business success.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I believe in the harmony between art and technology. Outside of
            work, I enjoy exploring different art forms like Zentangle and
            Geometric art. These creative outlets inspire me to approach
            projects with a fresh perspective and find innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thank you for gracing my website with your presence, and I eagerly
            anticipate crossing paths with you soon.
